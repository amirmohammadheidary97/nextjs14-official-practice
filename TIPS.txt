Next js Image Component 

The <Image> Component is an extension of the HTML <img> tag, and comes with automatic image optimization, such as:

Preventing layout shift automatically when images are loading.
Resizing images to avoid shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport.
Lazy loading images by default (images load as they enter the viewport).
Serving images in modern formats, like WebP and AVIF, when the browser supports it.

Why optimize fonts?
Fonts play a significant role in the design of a website, but using custom fonts in your project
 can affect performance if the font files need to be fetched and loaded.

Cumulative Layout Shift is a metric used by Google to evaluate the performance and user
experience of a website. With fonts, layout shift happens when the browser initially renders
text in a fallback or system font and then swaps it out for a custom font once it has loaded.
This swap can cause the text size, spacing, or layout to change, shifting elements around it.

Automatic code-splitting and prefetching
To improve the navigation experience, Next.js automatically code splits your application
by route segments. This is different from a traditional React SPA, where the browser loads all 
your application code on initial load.

Splitting code by routes means that pages become isolated. If a certain page throws an error,
the rest of the application will still work.

Furthermore, in production, whenever <Link> components appear in the browser's viewport,
Next.js automatically prefetches the code for the linked route in the background.
By the time the user clicks the link, the code for the destination page will already
be loaded in the background, and this is what makes the page transition near-instant!
